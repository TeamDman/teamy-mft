// NOTE on layout and safety for IOCP:
// We intentionally embed OVERLAPPED as the FIRST field and mark the
// struct as repr(C). With repr(C), field order and the offset of the
// first field are guaranteed, so the address of a ReadRequest value is
// equal to the address of its `overlapped` field. This allows us to pass
// `&mut read_req.overlapped` to ReadFile and later, when IO completes,
// recover the original allocation from the `lpOverlapped` pointer returned
// by GetQueuedCompletionStatus via a cast back to *mut ReadRequest.
//
// Safety invariants relied upon by this file:
// - `overlapped` MUST remain the first field of ReadRequest.
// - ReadRequest MUST remain `#[repr(C)]`.
// - Each queued I/O leaks its Box<ReadRequest> (Box::into_raw) so the
//   allocation outlives the async operation; ownership is reclaimed once
//   the completion is dequeued by converting the raw pointer back with
//   Box::from_raw exactly once.
// - We never move/relocate the allocation after queueing the I/O.
