- make resolve_paths_all_parallel take the drive letter name so that it gets included in the pathbufs
- make sync command write compressed representation of the paths next to the mft files
    - stack-based compression followed by gzip2
- create push-down automata for data pipelines - split tasks into individual chunks
    - for each drive (parallel)
        - open file
        - determine file size
        - mmap
        - detect entry size
        - copy bytes
        - apply fixups (parallel)
        - collect file name attributes (parallel)
        - resolve paths (parallel)
- ensure deleted files arent included? why are we seeing $RECYCLE.BIN entries if I've emptied my recycle bin?
